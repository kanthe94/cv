Hello!

I am <b>Ganesh Kanthe</b> and I live in Mumbai. When I am not busy with my work, I like playing cricket, table tennis, and badminton. Having worked on multiple projects with various industries like IT, FinTech, education, and insurance, I am blessed to have experienced diverse cultures and work ethics.

On a side note, I am also proud of being able to shape the future of young students. Being an engineer and IT professional, I believe it's our duty to help students make an informed choice when it comes to their education.

<b><i>My secret to success is discipline and being organized.</i></b>
